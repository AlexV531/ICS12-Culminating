The weird looking orange thing with a white outline that drops from enemies is a powerup. It increases your rate of fire for a short time. It's fun to mess around in the physics when you get one, try it out.

There are currently 3 weapons, pistol, bound to 1, shotgun, bound to 2, and assault rifle, bound to 3. My personal favourite is the assault rifle, combining it with a powerup you can really gain some speed.

(Currently the Play Again button in the end screen is broken, it is best just to quit)
